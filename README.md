# ST449 - Artificial Intelligence - MT 2023-2024

Please refer to the Moodle course page for course details. This repository hosts some additional images used in notebooks for seminars.

## Preparation actions before attending the seminar sessions:

### Software installation on your personal computer

We will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), so, you don't need to install anything.
We may also use a [Binder Environment](http://mybinder.org/repo/aimacode/aima-python) for running some code examples.

But in case you want to run all the examples on your personal computer, do the following:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html#) with Python 3.x.
2. Install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), version 2.x.
3. Install [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and check the [Documentation](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/).

Further instructions to install other software will follow on a weekly basis, depending on the contents we will be studying.

### Lecture's example code

The example code will use the [aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) repository. If you prefer to run things on your own computer, please download or clone this repository into your local computer and run the examples using Anaconda and Jupyter notebook (not recommended). Please, observe that these examples use modified versions of some Python libraries (e.g. `utils`, `notebooks` etc). Also, make sure you download/clone the [aima-data](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-data/tree/f6cbea61ad0c21c6b7be826d17af5a8d3a7c2c86) repository as well.

### Register for some online services/systems

4. Set up a [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) workspace (optionally, you can link your GitHub account).
5. Take the [pre-sessional course on Python and SQL](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=8289), curated by LSE Digital Skills Lab.

### Attend the course and engage with the proposed activities

6. Make sure you attend all course sessions (lectures and seminars).
7. Make sure you engage with all the proposed activities.
8. Have your say! Bring your questions, suggestions, complains etc - they are all welcome!
9. Have fun studying and learning Artificial Intelligence!
